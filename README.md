Although DNKs are being used by 800+ exporters, DoP is still not able to bring small traders, artisans and MSMEs onto the DNK platform as most of such entrepreneurs do not have the wherewithal to create web portals for displaying their products and accepting International e-Commerce orders, or they are find the regulatory and e-Commerce platform compliances too expensive or tedious. Moreover, the international customers find it difficult to trust the webportals or small entities.
